# Creation of a JAVAFX Application

## Main objectives

As part of a school project, I decided to create an application using **JAVAFX**, in order for a fictional company called "Kybu" to access and manage all the employees.
All the database information are accessible through a **REST API**. The API I created is also available on my GitHub profile. As Kybu is a company specialized in selling Marvel, Nintendo and Blizzard goodies, I chose to create the design accordingly.

The main features of this application are :
- **Dynamic filters** using the name, surname or email address.
- Access the employees list **by service** (marketing, HR...) or **location** (Brest, Paris, Nice...)
- A specific "administrator" profile to access the **CRUD functions** (create, update or delete an employee, site or service)

## The main page 

After logging in with their professionnal email and password, employees have access to the main page and can handle their search as they wish :

## Administrator profile

By typing **CTRL+Alt+A**, the employee can access the administrator pop-up window, and enter the administrator login and password. Afterwards, he can **upload, delete** and **create** an employee, service or site (location).

## Update employee pop-up

All the CRUD functions are displayed in a specific pop-up window, for example, here is the window to create a new employee.
